UPDATE: I may not be able to work on this due to a new job, sadly. If anyone wants to help out, please reach out to me. Otherwise, I can make no promises with if I'll be able to make progress on the project.

# OpenLegends
Open source remake of the card game The Elder Scrolls: Legends, which has shut down permanently in January 2025.

I am looking for Godot developers to help out with the project. If you're interested, please send me an email: aryo.nazaradeh@gmail.com
